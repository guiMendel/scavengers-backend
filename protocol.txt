This file is a simple text specification of how communication between agents and this server should take place.
Lines prefixed with < mean a message is sent by the agent, and > means the message is sent by the server.

1. Connection with gama app is established
2. < Global species states current scenario
3. < Each agent identifies itself with a unique identification token
4. Loop for each agent:
    4.1. < Agent provides: a state observation description, reward from last action (if applicable), and whether is terminal state
    4.2. > An action description is returned
    Obs. Loop breaks on connection interruption

=======================
    MESSAGE FORMAT
=======================

=== GLOBAL SPECIES MESSAGE

It's always a scenario identification message, following this format:
{
    "scenario": <scenario-name>
}

=== SCAVENGER MESSAGE

A scavenger's message must be a json according to the following rules:

1. There must be a field called id which holds the scavenger's id

2. On connection, the json object must contain a "connect" key which holds true

3. On action request, the object must contain the "request" key holding an object with 2 to 3 items:
    "state": holds a matrix representing the agent's observation
    "reward": holds the reward of the last state-action execution (if not applicable, holds null)
    "terminal": holds true if the current state is the terminal state (not included otherwise)
    Obs. please refer to the simulation documentation in order to understand how the observation matrix is represented

Example 1:

{
    "id": "Scav. 1",
    "connect": true
}

Example 2 (assuming observation matrix is 3x5):

{
    "id": "Scav. 3",
    "request": {
        "state": [
            [2, 0, 1, 0, 3],
            [0, 1, 1, 1, 3],
            [0, 2, 4, 0, 3]
        ],
        "reward": 0
    }
}

=== API MESSAGE

The api's response is a simple string that indicates the target agent and the action to be performed, separated by a ';' character.

Example:

"Scav. 3;idle"
